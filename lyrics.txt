Chorus
------
These are
Things I wish I knew
Back when I was young
Back when I was a fool


Brock verse 1
-------------
If people say
You read too much
You need more friends
And other such

You say to them
You'll read all day,
That reading is
A form of play

Beth verse 1
------------
If you are trapped
On a desert Isle
And there's nothing
For miles and miles

Peanut butter
Is all you need
... (I need to find the rest)
